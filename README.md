Hello stranger 👋

This github follows little part of my learning development, and I occasionally post larger projects that progress day by day in complexity. Wish me luck, and follow my progress. : D

👀 I’m interested in software engineering

🌱 I’m currently learning the MERN stack, PERN stack, and other web techonologies

💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects which will help me gain knowledge and experience
